                    I embarked on my educational journey in 2009 at Leer Nursery and Primary School in South Sudan,
                     where I laid a strong foundation for my academic pursuits. Building upon this early education, 
                     I continued my secondary studies at Alliance High Secondary School in Uganda, where I further 
                     honed my skills and broadened my knowledge. Subsequently, I advanced my education at Mat Secondary
                     School in South Sudan, where I deepened my understanding of various subjects and prepared myself for
                    future academic and professional endeavors. This diverse educational background has equipped me with 
                    a robust and well-rounded foundation, enabling me to approach challenges with a comprehensive and 
                    informed perspective.

                    I am currently engaged in an academic program in Information Systems and Technology at 
                    United States International University-Africa. This rigorous curriculum is designed to equip me with a 
                    comprehensive understanding of both theoretical and practical aspects of the field. Through my studies, 
                    I am gaining proficiency in various technologies and methodologies, which are essential for addressing 
                    complex challenges in today's digital landscape. My education at this esteemed institution is providing 
                    me with the skills and knowledge necessary to excel in the dynamic and ever-evolving world of information 
                    technology.
